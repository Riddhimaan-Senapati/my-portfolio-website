          Hello! I&apos;m Riddhimaan, a passionate software developer and AI/ML enthusiast.
          My journey in tech has led me to explore various domains, from web development to machine learning. 
          I&apos;m constantly learning and adapting to new technologies, always excited to take on challenging 
          projects that push the boundaries of what&apos;s possible.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-4">
          When I&apos;m not coding, you can find me exploring the latest developments in AI, 
          contributing to open-source projects like Langfair, Dify etc. I love solving real-world 
          problems with technology and am always looking for opportunities to make a positive impact.
